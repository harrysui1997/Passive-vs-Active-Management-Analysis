# Passive-vs-Active-Management-Analysis

## Tpoic of Research
We want to compare the performance between management funds and ETF/Markets in the past three years (2018-2021) to answer a few questions?
1. Does these management plans outperform ETF/Markets during a correction period ?
2. Is there any association between daily covid19 cases and Market?
