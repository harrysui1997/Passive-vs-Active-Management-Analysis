# Passive-vs-Active-Management-Analysis

## Topic of Research
We want to compare the performance between actively management funds vs ETF/Market (S&p 500) in the past three years (2018-2021) to answer a few questions?
1. Does the fund managers outperform ETF/Markets during a correction period ?
2. Is there any association between daily covid19 cases and the Market?

## Analysis Methodology
Through the use of financial ratios we will compare, returns, volatility, and risk of actively managed mutual funds vs the passive index solutions (S&P 500).
We will also look at covid cases and deaths to see what effects they have on the market
